## A rough guide to the code

The demo app is a React app. It uses a `src/Data.js` to fetch the data and `src/Layout.js` to handle the layout of the page. The three.js visualization code is in `src/Projection.js`. The texture atlases are in the public folder as images.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
